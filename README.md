## Overview

Django e-commerce web application - an online library of academic tools & books.
The objectives of this project encompass two key aspects. Firstly, I designed and developed a comprehensive eCommerce application utilizing Django, tailored specifically for an online bookstore catering to programming students. This web application will encompass essential features such as an extensive product catalogue, personalized user profiles, secure payment integration, shopping cart management, and streamlined order processing. By focusing on the unique needs and preferences of programming students, we aim to create an intuitive and engaging platform that fosters an optimal learning experience.

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the virtual environment `env` 
- `cd` back into the root directory and run the application `python manage.py runserver` or `py manage.py runserver`

The application is accessed from the branch `recovery-branch2` for now.
